# OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse

## Description

The OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse package provides tools for analyzing and comparing microbial species in the oral microbiome of individuals who use substances, including tobacco, cannabis, and other drugs. This package is designed to support research on microbial diversity and distribution within substance user groups, helping to identify common or unique microbial species associated with each type of substance use. By facilitating comparisons across different user groups, the package fills a gap in bioinformatics workflows focused on the oral microbiome of substance users.

This package is particularly beneficial for researchers studying the impact of substance use on oral health, as it allows for the visualization of microbial species variations and outputs summary tables that aid in exploring these relationships. The tools offered improve workflows by integrating microbial species data analysis, comparison functions, and visualization capabilities within a single package, streamlining analyses that would otherwise require separate tools and significant manual processing.

The package was developed using R version 4.4.1 and on platform x86_6-apple-danwin20 Mac, running under macOS Sonoma 14.3.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

# Install OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse from GitHub
devtools::install_github("Maryam-hkiabi/OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# Load the package
library("OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse")

Note: The Shiny app for this package is currently under construction.
```

To run the shinyApp: Under construction

## Overview

``` r
# List of all functions and datasets in the package
ls("package:OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse")

# List of any included datasets, if available
data(package = "OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse")

# Access the package vignettes for a tutorial
browseVignettes("OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse")
```

OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse contains 10 functions:

1)  ***load_data()***

Loads and preprocesses microbiome data from a user-specified file (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON). This function ensures that the data is correctly formatted for analysis.

2)  ***clean_sequences()***

Cleans and formats raw sequence data to prepare it for BLAST analysis, removing contaminants and standardizing data.

3)  ***run_blast()***

Performs a BLAST search on the provided microbial sequences, querying NCBI to retrieve taxonomic information for each sequence.

4)  ***download_homd_data()***

Retrieves microbial species data from the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), allowing users to obtain reference data on the human oral microbiome.

5)  ***parse_megan()***

Parses MEGAN output files, extracting taxonomic and functional data. This function is useful for users who have run microbiome analyses in MEGAN and want to integrate the results.

6)  ***compare_groups()***

Compares microbial communities between substance users and non-users, identifying unique or common species between these groups.

7)  ***compare_substances()***

Compares microbial communities across different types of substance users (e.g., smokers vs. cannabis users).

8)  ***species_table()***

Generates a summary table listing microbial species presence and frequency across different substance use types.

9)  ***visualize_taxonomy()***

Creates a bar plot or heatmap to visualize the taxonomic profiles, showing diversity and abundance of species across different groups.

10) ***plot_species_substance()***

Plots the presence and relative abundance of microbial species across different substance use types, providing a visual comparison.

**This package can run on 3 types of datasets:**

1)  user-provided: load own data in JSON, EXCEL or CSV format

2)  sample-dataset: run package on provided sample dataset already inlcuded in this package

3)  retrieve-data: retrieve data directly from Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD)

## Example output of plots from sample data

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/maryamhasanzadehkiabi/Desktop/preview2.png")

```
