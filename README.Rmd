# OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse

<!-- badges: start -->

## Description

The OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse package provides tools for analyzing and comparing microbial species in the oral microbiome of individuals who use substances, including tobacco, cannabis, and other drugs. This package is designed to support research on microbial diversity and distribution within substance user groups, helping to identify common or unique microbial species associated with each type of substance use. By facilitating comparisons across different user groups, the package fills a gap in bioinformatics workflows focused on the oral microbiome of substance users.

This package is particularly beneficial for researchers studying the impact of substance use on oral health, as it allows for the visualization of microbial species variations and outputs summary tables that aid in exploring these relationships. The tools offered improve workflows by integrating microbial species data analysis, comparison functions, and visualization capabilities within a single package, streamlining analyses that would otherwise require separate tools and significant manual processing.

The package was developed using R version 4.4.1 and on platform x86_6-apple-danwin20 Mac, running under macOS Sonoma 14.3.
